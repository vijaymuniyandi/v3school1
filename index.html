<p align="center">Computer programmer skills are methods and processes that provide computers with instructions on what actions to perform. Collectively known as “code,” these instructions are written by computer programmers to solve problems or perform specific tasks.Programming generally results in a specific set of actions or the creation of a tangible result, whether it is a software application, a web page or even just an image displayed on a computer screen. Computer programmer skills often combine creativity with technical and analytical elements. In many ways, programming represents a perfect merging of art and science.

<small>
<p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
</p>
<p2>
The base or father of programming languages is ‘ALGOL.’ It was first introduced in 1960. ‘ALGOL’ was used on a large basis in European countries. ‘ALGOL’ introduced the concept of structured programming to the developer community. In 1967, a new computer programming language was announced called as ‘BCPL’ which stands for Basic Combined Programming Language. BCPL was designed and developed by Martin Richards, especially for writing system software. This was the era of programming languages. Just after three years, in 1970 a new programming language called ‘B’ was introduced by Ken Thompson that contained multiple features of ‘BCPL.’ This programming language was created using UNIX operating system at AT&T and Bell Laboratories. Both the ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ were system programming languages.

<small>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc.

Before explaining the basics of C++ , I would like to clarify two more ideas: low level and high level. To make it easy to understand, let’s consider this scenario – when we go to Google search engine and search for some queries, Google displays us some websites according to our question. Google does this for us at a very high level. We don’t know what’s happening at the low level until we look into Google servers (at a low level) and further to the level where the data is in the form of 0s/1s. The point I want to make here is that low level means nearest to the hardware, and a high level means farther from the hardware with a lot of layers of abstraction. C ++ is considered as low level language as it is closer to hardware than most general – purpose programming languages. 

However to become proficient in any programming language, one Firstly needs to understand the basics of that language.

<br><h2 style="background-color:green">JAVA PROGRAMMING</h2>
<small>
<p>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.
Java is fast, reliable and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner.

Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
